# Loss Control Plus Hiring Project

## Full-Stack Web Developer

- [Install Dependencies](#install)
- [Run](#run)

The project is consisted of 2 folders:

```
  /client
  /server
```

where the `/client` folder contains the frontend application created using Ionic and Angular Framework. The `/server` is built using NodeJS and Express.

### Environment Setup

I recommend the following environment setup to run the project:

```
  ionic     : v5.0.0
  ionic-cli : v6.10.1
  NodeJS    : v12.16.3 or latest LTS
  npm       : v6.14.4
```

### Install

First, before running the app. Please run `npm install` first. This will install both the client's and server's dependencies.

### Run

To start the app, run `npm run dev` to run both the client and the server. The client is running on `http:localhost:8100` and the server is running on `http:localhost:3000`
